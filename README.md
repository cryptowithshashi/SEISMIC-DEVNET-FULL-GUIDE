## FAQ ANSWERED FROM SEISMIC

1. What if I'm on Windows?

We recommend using WSL to run commands as if you were on a Linux machine. Run

```bash
  wsl --install
```
Now restart your computer. After booting back up, you should be able to run the below command and follow the rest of the steps like normal


```bash
  wsl

```
---
2. I'm stuck at 1108/1112 when running sfoundryup.
Some machines take up to an hour to do this step. If it takes longer, ask a question in our Discord's #devnet channel.

---

3. I'm getting Command failed: cargo build --bins --release.

Means your machine doesn't have Cargo. If you're on Linux, run
```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential
  sudo apt install cargo -y

```
---

4. I'm getting jq (command not found)?
Means step #2 didn't work. If you're on Linux, run:
```bash
  sudo apt-get install jq

```
---

5. I'm getting Address not funded. Please check if your faucet transaction went...
Means your wallet has no testnet ETH. Please go to the faucet, enter the address the script gave you, and wait for the green confirmation.

---

6. I'm getting Command 'brew' not found?
Means your machine doesn't have the Homebrew package manager. Run:
```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

---

7. I'm getting linker 'cc' not found.
You can resolve it by running:

```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential
  sudo apt install cargo -y

```

---

8. I'm getting command not found: sfoundryup.
If this comes up even after you complete step #3 successfully, restart your terminal. You should be able to run it after.

----

9. I'm getting info: aborting installation.
Means you aren't selecting an option for your Rust installation. Run the curl command again, and press Enter.

---

10. I'm getting Command: 'bun' not found.
You need to add bun to your PATH. You can either do this temporarily in your current terminal via the command below (you'll have to do it for every new window):

```bash
  export PATH="/home/$(whoami)/.bun/bin:$PATH"

```

```bash
  export PATH="/home/$(whoami)/.bun/bin:$PATH"

```
